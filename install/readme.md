# Installation

If you want to install the Movie Tunes App on your Android device, you have to enable "Third Party Apps Installation" in your settings. Visit [this](http://www.android.pk/blog/tutorials/how-to-enable-third-party-apps-installation-on-android-phones/) for more information.

Then download the Movie Tunes apk from the [release page](https://github.com/VSSSE/VSS-Mobile/releases) and open it with your installation manager.

Please leave some feedback in the issues, so that we can improve our aplication.
